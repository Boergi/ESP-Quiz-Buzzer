## 📢 Instructions for Wedding Guests (to read aloud)

*"Dear wedding guests, attention please! We have something special for you:*

*Before we go to the buffet, we're going to play a little game to determine the order! Each table has a buzzer in its own color. Please appoint a 'Buzzer Master' at your table - this is the person who will operate the buzzer for you.*

*Here's how it works: I'll ask you a question about the bride and groom. Your buzzer will then pulse in your table color - that means: You can buzz now! Discuss quickly at your table and when you have an answer, your Buzzer Master presses the button.*

*Whoever buzzes first, their buzzer will spin in your color and show: It's your turn! Quickly choose a speaker who will give the answer.*

*If the answer is correct, there will be a colorful rainbow show on your buzzer and your table gets to go to the buffet next! If it's wrong, your buzzer will briefly flash red and the next table in the queue gets their turn.*

*Important: Only buzz when your buzzer is pulsing! If it's constantly lit, you have to wait.*

*This way the buffet will be distributed fairly and fun! Are you ready for the first question?"*
